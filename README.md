# Quoridoraner
Artifical Intelligence and GUI for the classic board game "Quoridor". Works with the help of NegaMax and Alpha-Beta-Pruning to calculate the best moves.


## Compilation
You need a working [wxWidgets](www.wxwidgets.org)-Installation and [CMake](cmake.org) for building.
Then just generate the Makefile/Project with CMake and compile.

## Controls
### Movement
Use the Top, Right, Left, Bottom Buttons on the GUI
### Barrier Placement
Click the vertical or horizontal shaped buttons. Then click the square on the field that is at the left bottom corner of your planned barrier. (It sounds complicated, but just try it out and hopefully it will be easy.)
